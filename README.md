# Norns mod. txo nb voice.

This mod allows you to use a txo / txo+ as an nb voice via crow. The following functions are covered:

* basic monphonic voice (oscillator + AR envelope + overall peak volume/velocity)
* wave selection - range covers 327 wave types included in a txo+ - just use first 5? indexes for a plain txo
* blending between main wavetable types

Still to do:
* slew
* poly voice
* unison voice
* more refinement of wavetable navigation / modulation
* pulse width modulation for the variable square wave
* * interesting things with trigger outputs
